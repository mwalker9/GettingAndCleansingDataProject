# GettingAndCleansingDataProject

This project uses cleanses and preps data using some basic R programming functions.  The dataset this code is intended to run on is data collected from a wearable accelerometer (think accelerometer data from fitbit for instance).  The code combines the training and test sets to preprocess the data together, keeps only certain columns and then makes the column names easier to read.
